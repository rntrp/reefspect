# Reefspect 🪸
Reefspect is a security‑focused microservice designed to analyze files submitted via multipart requests. It provides a clean, modern API for scanning uploaded content, making it easy to integrate malware detection into any application or pipeline.

## Core Technologies
Reefspect is built with a focus on performance, safety, and modern async architecture. Its core components work together to deliver a fast, reliable malware‑scanning service that fits naturally into cloud‑native environments.

* [Rust](https://rust-lang.org) is a popular programming language with an emphasis on memory safety and performance.
* [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum) is a modern, ergonomic web framework built on top of the [Tokio](https://tokio.rs) async runtime.
* [ClamAV](https://www.clamav.net) is the legendary malware scanning engine integrated via the [official bindings](https://github.com/Cisco-Talos/clamav-async-rs).

## Build
The program requires the `libclamav` dynamic library at runtime and the corresponding header files for building:
* At least ClamAV 1.4.x libs and header files, including `/usr/lib**/libclamav.so.12`, `/usr/include/clamav.h` etc.
* Those files must be available via `pkg-config`, i.e. `/usr/lib**/pkgconfig/libclamav.pc` must be present
* Rust must be [installed](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)

The most convenient option is to install `libclamav` development files from the official package sources:
* __Debian Trixie__: [libclamav-dev](https://packages.debian.org/trixie/libclamav-dev)
* __Ubuntu Noble__: [libclamav-dev](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/noble/+package/libclamav-dev)
* __Arch Linux__: [clamav](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/clamav/)
* __Fedora 42+__ or __EPEL8+__ [clamav-devel](https://packages.fedoraproject.org/pkgs/clamav/clamav-devel/)

Then just do `cargo build` or straightaway `cargo run` on the repo root so that cargo automatically downloads all the dependencies and builds the binary.

## Launch

### From Source Files
Just use `cargo` from the repo root. Make sure all the prerequisites are met.
```sh
cargo run
```

### As Docker Container
```sh
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 rntrp/reefspect
```
Or pull from the GitHub Registry in place of Docker Hub:
```sh
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 ghcr.io/rntrp/reefspect
```

## Usage
* `/` leads to a simple HTML page with a form upload. Aliases
* `/health` is a simple health check endpoint
* `/metrics` provides metrics in Prometheus format
* `/shutdown` initiates graceful shutdown on a POST request (disabled by default)
* `/upload` will accept files via POST `multipart/form-data` request. Returns a JSON after upload and scan:

## FAQ

**Q: Are scanned files loaded completely into memory?**

**A:** No, uploads are transferred into temp files in a streaming manner. `libclamav` then uses memory mapping on temp files when scanning for malware. Unless the temp directory is located on a RAM drive, an uploaded file is never entirely loaded into memory. Temp files are deleted automatically after the request completes.


**Q: Where are the temp files stored?**

**A:** Temp files are written to the OS temp directory. This directory is designated by the `TMPDIR` environment variable which resolves to `/tmp` on Linux by default. Also make sure to provide enough disk space to handle bigger files in parallel requests.


**Q: I am getting the following log message at startup. Is it normal?**
```
LibClamAV Warning: **************************************************
LibClamAV Warning: ***  The virus database is older than 7 days!  ***
LibClamAV Warning: ***   Please update it as soon as possible.    ***
LibClamAV Warning: **************************************************
```

**A:** The application itself does not update the virus database. The most conventional way to update the database is to run `freshclam` periodically. When using Docker, an init container with `freshclam` to update the database is a good choice. Alternatively, you can still manage and copy the CVD files manually: database files are located at `/var/lib/clamav`.
